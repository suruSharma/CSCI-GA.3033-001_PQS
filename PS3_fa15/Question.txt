You have been provided with a fellow studentsâ€™ submission.  For this assignment you need to write unit tests to verify that the submission meets the assignment requirements and to uncover any possible bugs or ambiguities in the code.

Eclipse can run JUnit tests without any additional software.  To measure code coverage you will need to install the EclEmma Ecplise plugin.  Your goal in this assignment it not only to obtain as much coverage as possible but to write clean, effective, and thorough unit tests.

If you write any tests that discover bugs please leave the test as is and include a comment that explains that the test fails because of a bug in the implementation.
